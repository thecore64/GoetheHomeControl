FRAMEWORK FOR DEFINING HOME CONTROL DEVICES
===========================================

Device IP addresses
-------------------
For each device a fixed IP address in the network should be used.
Just a randomly choosen numbering could be:

SWI devices start with xxx.xxx.0.10

DIM devices start with xxx.xxx.0.20

CMD devices start with xxx.xxx.0.30

This makes it easier, together with device naming, to use Over the Air Update.
Make sure to never (!) program two modules with the same IP !!
This will end up with a mess in your network and your devices !!

Device naming
-------------
Devices use clear text names and consist of two parts.
The first part is a 3 capital letter code, which identifies the type of the device.
SWI = switch device, basically simple on/off switches
DIM = dimmer device, to control Brightness
CMD = command device, with a certain number of buttons or touch button to control other 
      SWI or DIM devices
SNS = sensor device, which is usually only publishing values, like temperature or humidity or both

The second part is a freely definable name, like "LivingRoom" or "BedRoom". For practical reasons, 
this name should give information about the location of the device.

The complete name of a device will look like this:
SWIBedRoom, CMDLivingRoom, CMDHAllway or SNSOutside
Of course there can be combined devices, e.g. a dimmer can also be a switch (a switch in a dimmer 
can be a "logical" switch, which just switches the brightness with one "switch" message to 100%)
The name would be a combination too, like "DIMSWI__________". 
Another example would be a switch containing a temperature sensor, its name would be "SWISNS........".


State variables
---------------
When you control devices from different places, each command device needs to know the state 
of the controlled device at any time.

For that we use a special variable, which will be sent over MQTT. This variable needs to be received
(subscribed) by every device which needs to know it, e.g. for displaying the state on a display or
for another command device which is controlling the same switch or dimmer.

Variable has always the prefix "state". For example if a switch is controlled by the MQTT 
message "Switch1", then the controlled device, the switch has to publich a variable which is called
"stateSwitch1". In case of a switch, the value can only be 0 or 1.
For e.g. the brightness for a dimmer, this could be the MQTT message "Brightness1" to control the
brightness of an LED. The device has to publish a variable called "stateBrightness1", here it can
a value between maximum and minimum brightness, e.g. 0 - 1024 for a 10 bit PWM.



Q: can a all state variables be received by subscribing to "state*" ??
